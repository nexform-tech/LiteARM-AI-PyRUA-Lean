PyRUA-Lean code policy, for engineers who need a reproducible setup of the
simulator, policy server and robot assets.

# LiteArm AI, PyRUA-Lean on RoboDojo

This repository contains both halves of the stack. The policy server writes
robot programs against the LiteArm tools; the RoboDojo client executes them in
Isaac Sim. It includes the LiteArm robot asset, environment configuration,
evaluation scripts and the data used for the official `stack_blocks` run.

## Demo

`stack_blocks`, seed 0, on the reference machine:

`cover_blocks`, seed 0:

`align_blocks`, seed 0:

Full video: [align_blocks.mp4](docs/assets/videos/align_blocks.mp4)

The `stack_blocks` seed-0 evaluation completed with success rate 1.0 and score
100 after 1379 steps. The `align_blocks` seed-0 run on 2026-11-03 also returned
success rate 1.0 and score 100. The simulator ran on Ubuntu 22.04 with an RTX
4060 8 GB; the policy server ran on a Jetson AGX Thor 128 GB. The recordings are
from reference-machine runs.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04 on x86_64. Other Linux distributions are not verified.
- An NVIDIA GPU with a current driver. The simulator runs on 8 GB at the 160x120 camera resolution used here. SAM3, the policy server's segmentation model, needs another 5-6 GB, so use two hosts below 16 GB total, or one host with at least 16 GB.
- About 40 GB of disk for Isaac Sim and IsaacLab, plus tens of GB for the RoboDojo asset dataset and 3.4 GB for the SAM3 checkpoint.
- Conda or Miniconda, `git`, `git-lfs`, and `wget`.
- An OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint and an API key. No key is stored in this repository.

## Quick start on one machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nexform-tech/LiteARM-AI-PyRUA-Lean.git
cd LiteARM-AI-PyRUA-Lean
bash scripts/setup.sh
bash scripts/fetch_assets.sh
cp config/env.example.sh config/env.sh
# edit config/env.sh with your endpoint, key and model name
bash scripts/run_eval.sh --task stack_blocks --seed 0
```

`scripts/setup.sh` installs both conda environments and can take an hour or more
on a fresh host. Use `--skip-sim` on a policy-server host and `--skip-policy` on
a simulator host. The scripts encode the reference-machine steps; a fresh-host
run is not verified. See [Setup](docs/setup.md) for the verification status.

**Do not** commit `config/env.sh`, paste the key into an issue, or put it in a
script; the file is git-ignored.

## Split setup

Run these commands from the repository root on each host.

Policy server host:

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh --skip-sim
bash scripts/fetch_assets.sh --policy-only
cp config/env.example.sh config/env.sh
# edit config/env.sh
bash scripts/run_server.sh
```

Simulator host:

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh --skip-policy
bash scripts/fetch_assets.sh --skip-sam3
POLICY_HOST=192.168.1.10 bash scripts/run_client.sh
```

`scripts/fetch_assets.sh --policy-only` downloads only the SAM3 checkpoint. The
simulator host downloads the RoboDojo dataset and installs the LiteArm asset;
`--skip-sam3` keeps the checkpoint off that host.
